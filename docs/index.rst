Welcome to model-fit's documentation
====================================

This is the documentation for `model-fit`_, a Python library for
convenient non-linear least-squared fitting of analytical model to
data. This library is similar to the excellent `lmfit`_ package but is
a fresh implementation designed with support for global fitting of
several curves with parameter tying.

You may want to start at :doc:`getting_started` or go directly to the
:doc:`library_reference`.
