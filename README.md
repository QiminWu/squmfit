# squmfit â€” Convenient global fitting

Squmfit (pronounced "squim-fit") is a Python library for flexible
non-linear least-squares fitting of models to curves. Squmfit is
distinguished from [`lmfit`][lmfit] in its treatment of fit parameters
as first-class objects, naturally accomodating global fitting across
multiple curves with tied parameters.

See [ReadTheDocs][rtd] for documentation.
